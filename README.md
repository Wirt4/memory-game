# memory-game
JS -based memory game taken from the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc 

can unflip the cards with event listeners, but having diffuculty re-flipping them with the query selctor model presented

Idea: refactor functions to run with unit tests to gain deeper understanding of state of DOM before trying to fix the checkForMatch logic, an alternative would be the classic document.getElementById

idea: add an unmatchable card that is automatic loss if overturned
idea: make game scalable, more cards means less chance of overturning "bomb" but more matches need to be made?
