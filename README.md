# memory-game
JS -based memory game taken from the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc 

Step 1: Gather assets

idea: add an unmatchable card that is automatic loss if overturned
idea: make game scalable, more cards means less chance of overturning "bomb" but more matches need to be made?
